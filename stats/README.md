__Permutation tests (as described by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Permutation_tests))__. A permutation test is a type of statistical significance test in which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic under rearrangements of the labels on the observed data points. In other words, the method by which treatments are allocated to subjects in an experimental design is mirrored in the analysis of that design. If the labels are exchangeable under the null hypothesis, then the resulting tests yield exact significance levels. Confidence intervals can then be derived from the tests. The theory has evolved from the works of Ronald Fisher and EJG Pitman in the 1930s.

I have generated two scripts – `permutationTestDist.r` and `permutationTestMean.r` – as laid out by this [StackExchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/136661/using-bootstrap-under-h0-to-perform-a-test-for-the-difference-of-two-means-repl) discussion to test whether the the distribution of _x_ and _y_ are identical and whether or not their population means are equal, without making any assumptions about their variance. To use, load your list of values in _x_ and _y_.
